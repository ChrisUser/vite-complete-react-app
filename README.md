# 🚀 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

<br />

## ⚡️ start

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

<br />

## 🧪 test

```
npm test
```

or

```
yarn test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

<br />

## 🦾 build

```
npm build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

<br />

## 🧶 lint

```
npm lint
```

or

```
yarn lint
```

Creates a `.eslintcache` file in which ESLint cache is stored. Running this command can dramatically improve ESLint's running time by ensuring that only changed files are linted.

<br />

## 🎯 format

```
npm format
```

or

```
yarn format
```

Checks if your files are formatted. This command will output a human-friendly message and a list of unformatted files, if any.
